As you step into one of the foresaken ships the ground collapses under you, and you fall into the brig! A ghostly pirate appears before you and says, 'It’s been some time since we’ve had guests, it has. Provide us a wee bit o’ entertainment and perhaps we’ll consider letting yee go. If we like yee enough, maybe we’ll even grant yee a boon'"
        text2="Well, you're stuck in the brig so it's not like you have much choice. Might as well humor this ghost pirate...who knows, maybe you'll win them over!"
