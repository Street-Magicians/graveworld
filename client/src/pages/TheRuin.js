As you approach a clearing, you discover it’s not a person at all - it’s a spirit! The light hovers in midair, and speaks, 'I can’t remember the last time I had visitors; I’ve been alone so long I’ve forgotten who I am. Help me remember, and I’ll return the favor.'"
        text2="You need all the support you can get to banish the demon, and if this ally is as powerful as they say it would be worth helping out."
